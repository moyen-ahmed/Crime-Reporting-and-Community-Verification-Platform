# Crime-Reporting-and-Community-Verification-Platform
The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to report crimes in their area, attach evidence (images/videos), and enable the community to verify the authenticity of the reports through upvotes, downvotes, and comments with mandatory proof attachments
